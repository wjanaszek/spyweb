*Backend*
Edit IntelliJ run configurations to run main class annotated with `SpringBootApplication`. After configuring api server will be available on `8080` port.

*Frontend*
If running first time, go to `frontend`, then run command `npm install` (you have to have Node installed, if not go to it's website and download it). 

After `npm install` finished succesfully, run `npm start`. Open your browser and insert `localhost:4200` to see running Angular web app.
